# Slide Remote (remote-pc)

A useful tool to control slides when doing a group presentation by looking at somebody elseâ€™s screen via 
online conferencing platforms. This tool will instantly allow you to go to the next and previous slides by 
sending keyboard inputs to the PC which is sharing the screen. `socket.io` was used to handle real-time 
communication.
